    REGRESSION TEST: Ensure verify_schema.py uses get_engine() not lazy engine proxy.

    - database.py exports 'engine' as _EngineLazy proxy for backwards compatibility
    - SQLAlchemy's inspect() cannot handle proxy objects
    - verify_schema.py must use get_engine() to get real engine instance

    This test prevents regression of the lazy engine bug.
